I just check the last time that I have blogged. 9 years ago. Or actually a few programming languages ago. The very few blog posts I've written were about PHP. Since then I've had great fun with Python and more recently with Swift. Using the Internet Archive: Wayback Machine, I've restored the few posts I'd written.
